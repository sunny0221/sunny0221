- 🌱 I’m currently learning in the joy of coding course, finding it rather challenging.  Almost like learning greek!!!!  But I love a challenge!!!...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects.  I am into my second round and just started mod 2 in the program but I look forward to be able to help others go through what I am going through and hopefully make life easier for everyone!!!  I am finally getting to understand and need to learn loom so I can converse with others!!!!
- 📫 How to reach me - I am usually in the dm on help!!  LOL  But I can be reached through the discord channel and accept friend requests from others in discord!!!!!
- 😄 Pronouns: I am a 'she'
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love crafts and sewing - I also love learning code and am learning how to use Github and python - will try vscode in the future.
